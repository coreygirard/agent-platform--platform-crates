//! Shared `/health` and `/_service-info` response shapes.
//!
//! Every agent-platform backend (drive, pigeon, granite, bowerbird) defines a
//! byte-identical `GET /health` returning `{"service": "<name>", "status":
//! "ok"}`, plus a `/_service-info` carrying the same `{service, protocol,
//! implementation_status, bind_addr, store}` core. These helpers are the single
//! source of truth for those shapes.
//!
//! They are *value builders*, not axum handlers: a backend's handler stays a
//! one-liner that wraps the returned struct in `axum::Json`, e.g.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use platform_lambda::health::{Health, ServiceInfo};
//! async fn health() -> axum::Json<Health> {
//!     axum::Json(Health::ok("pigeon"))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Keeping them as plain `Serialize` structs (rather than handlers bound to a
//! particular `AppState`) lets each service keep its own state type and its own
//! extra `_service-info` fields (drive, for instance, appends `default_limits`)
//! while still sharing the common core.

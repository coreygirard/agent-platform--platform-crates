//! The canonical outbound-fetch guard for user-supplied URLs (SSRF /
//! DNS-rebinding).
//!
//! Any service that POSTs to an address a *requester* chose — a webhook
//! callback, a fetch-this-URL feature — is one bad hostname away from being a
//! proxy into its own VPC: the cloud metadata endpoint (169.254.169.254), a
//! private-range service, loopback. This crate is the one copy of the defense.
//!
//! Two decisions, both deliberate:
//!
//! 1. **ALLOWLIST, not denylist.** [`ensure_public_ip`] accepts only globally
//!    routable unicast addresses. A denylist enumerating "private" ranges is
//!    perpetually incomplete — it fails OPEN on every range it forgot (and on
//!    every range IANA reserves next). The allow-shape fails CLOSED.
//!
//! 2. **Resolve, then PIN.** Checking the URL at registration time proves
//!    nothing at delivery time: a hostname that passed the check can later
//!    resolve to 169.254.169.254. [`resolve_pinned`] resolves the host
//!    immediately before the request, checks *every* returned address, and
//!    hands back a [`Destination`] that pins the HTTP client to exactly those
//!    socket addresses — so the connection cannot go anywhere else, and the
//!    check is redone on every attempt (including retries).
//!
//! A [`Destination`] is only constructible by passing the check, so "I built a
//! client without validating" is not a reachable state.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn f() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let url = platform_outbound_guard::validate_url("https://app.example/hook")?;
//! let destination = platform_outbound_guard::resolve_pinned(&url).await?;
//! let http = destination
//!     .client_builder()
//!     .timeout(std::time::Duration::from_secs(15))
//!     .build()?;
//! http.post(url).send().await?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```

//! Shared chirp-auth request-plumbing for agent-platform backends.
//!
//! Drive and Pigeon (and the others) carried near-identical auth glue:
//! - the same `Authorization: Bearer` extraction,
//! - the same trusted-header dev decoder (with the 128-char / no-control-char
//!   uid+agent validation),
//! - the same `x-user-id` / `x-agent-id` / `x-approval-grant` / `x-user-can-write`
//!   header names,
//! - the same "machine acting on behalf of a human via a grant" resolution.

//! This crate is the single source of truth for that plumbing. The

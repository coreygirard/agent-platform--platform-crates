//! A DynamoDB handle for the hardened data-plane vault that **cannot express a
//! delete**.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The vault account (`081348549030`) holds the platform's durable tables —
//! `t_drive_items`, `t_drive_coowned`, `t_chirp-auth_vault`, `t_granite_vault`,
//! `t_shriek_vault`, `t_amber-git_refs`, `t_spend_ledger`. Every runtime role
//! that reaches them (`t_drive_runtime`, `t_chirp-auth_runtime`,
//! `t_granite_runtime`, `t_shriek_runtime`) is granted exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! GetItem BatchGetItem Query Scan DescribeTable PutItem UpdateItem
//! ```
//!
//! `DeleteItem` is **withheld**, on purpose: irreversible destruction in the
//! vault is reserved for the email-gated deletion delegate. That is the central
//! guarantee of the hardened data plane.
//!
//! Until this crate, the guarantee was enforced in exactly two places — IAM at
//! runtime, and the memory of whoever was writing the store. Nothing stopped a
//! store method from calling `.delete_item()`; it compiled, passed review, and
//! passed tests. The three services that reach the vault had three different
//! answers:
//!
//! * **chirp-auth** got it right — routes by key and tombstones the vault path,
//!   with a `ScratchKey` type making a TTL-write to the vault structurally
//!   impossible.
//! * **drive** got it right by construction — its one production delete targets
//!   the erasure-KEY table in drive's own account, never a vault row. That is
//!   what crypto-shred is for.
//! * **shriek** did not. On 2026-08-24 a source-retirement feature shipped as
//!   `DeleteItem` and returned **500 on every call in production**:
//!   `shriek dynamo error: remove expectation: service error`.
//!
//! Two details make that worth a type rather than another comment. The
//! constraint was *already documented in both module headers of the files being
//! edited* ("IAM withholds `DeleteItem`") and was still missed. And the unit
//! tests could not catch it: the in-memory double modelled no permission
//! boundary, so 40 green tests certified an operation production forbids. A
//! test double more permissive than the real store is worse than no test.
//!
//! # What this does
//!
//! [`VaultClient`] owns the SDK client privately and re-exposes only the
//! permitted operations. `.delete_item()` is not a method that exists; the
//! failure moves from a production 500 to a compile error, which is the whole
//! point.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let vault = VaultClient::new(sdk_client);
//! vault.update_item().table_name(t).key("pk", pk)      // fine
//!      .update_expression("SET #d = :t") /* … */;
//! vault.delete_item();                                  // does not compile
//! ```
//!
//! To retire a vault row, **tombstone it**: an additive `UpdateItem` marking the
//! row, with every read path filtering marked rows. Guard it with
//! `condition_expression("attribute_exists(pk)")` so retiring an absent key is a
//! no-op rather than a silent upsert that creates a tombstone and reports
//! success.
//!
//! # What this does NOT do
//!
//! It is not a security boundary — IAM is, and it still is. Anyone can hold the
//! raw SDK client alongside this one. It removes the *accident*: the store
//! author who reaches for the obvious method and learns from production that
//! the platform forbids it.
